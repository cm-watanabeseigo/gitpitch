### "Skyfall" is WHAT??

@size[0.7em](("Done."... Japanese subtitle is "@color[orange](Finished)." ... What mean is it? ... Skyfall ... fall the sky. That feels have a huge scale... like "operation: Shuttered Skies"... It mean, I guess, Skyfall is something about a @color[orange](secret mission), operation, or code name itself assigned by the nation, a.k.a. MI6. However, James Bond looks strange somewhere... seems like lost his memory... Oh, dear? No... Ok, perhaps, 007 had completed the mission, but something happen with it. Because that accident, he lost memory with one or more critical things and was targeted by his own section, MI6...<br />(imagination))

@size[0.5em](„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ<- Shuttered Skies)
@snapend

@snap[south-east]
@size[3em](ü§î)
@snapend


Note:
- I imagine about this situation and meaning.
- I guess, "Skyfall" is code name of a dangerous mission or operation he assigned. perhaps, 007 completed that mission, but he lost his own memory. This is key of the movie.

### Real "Skyfall" is:

@ul[list](false)
- Subtitle is "@color[orange](The past)."
- Not an operation or a code name.
  - I don't write what it is for detail ;P
  - If you want to know the answer, watch this!
- "Finished." is just a @color[orange](misleading).
  - Not a @color[orange](trap).
  - Naturally occurring.
- The translator might not have any information.
  - Except the trailer itself
@ulend

@snap[south-east]
@size[0.6em](\* Note that the movie itself was very fun. Please do not misunderstand üòâ)
@snapend

Note:
- Yes! That's misleading!
- perhaps, it is Not a trap, but naturally occurring misleading.
- I think: when the trailer translating, The translator did not have any information about the story except the trailer.

---

### TIL (Today I Learned):

@ul[list](false)
To avoid misleading, @color[orange]("Context") is very important.  
@ulend
  
@quote[context = the **situation**, events, or **information** that are related to something and that **help you to understand it**](Longman Dictionary)
  
@ul[list](false)
- Share context first, and be able to use a @color[orange](simple word).
@ulend

Note:
- TIL is that:
- To avoid misleading, "Context" is very important.
- but, with reverse thinking, you can use just simple answer with already shared situaton.

---

### To explain the situation

@ul[list](false)
- Split between "Share context" and "Tell what you want to".
  - Unix philosophy: *Make each program @color[orange](do one thing) well.*
- **At this level**, Priority of Grammer is @color[orange](low)
  - but, It is important to understand English!
- DO NOT HESITATE TO USE SIMPLE WORDS!
@ulend

Note:
- Let's split between "Share context" and "Tell what you want to", as known as, "describe" and "desier".
- as you know, unix philosophy said that: Make each program do one thing well.
- english is the same. each sentence do one thing well.
